# eTickets
## Abstract
The topic of my thesis is the development and dockerization of the "eTickets" web
application in .NET programming language, which allows users to buy tickets online for
movies in different cinemas. Online shopping has been growing in popularity in recent
years and has become a common practice in many companies. There are several reasons
why it was introduced:
Convenience: Online shopping allows customers to access the Internet from home,
work or anywhere and easily purchase the products or services they want. They do not
need to be in person at traditional stores or make an appointment.
Wide selection: In the online space, customers have access to a huge selection of
products and services from many parts of the world. They are not limited to the inventory
of local stores and can easily compare prices, brands and quality from the comfort of their
own home.
Time saving: Online shopping is fast and efficient. Customers donâ€™t have to go
through multiple stores or stand in line to pay. They can simply buy and pay for a
product or service with a few clicks.
Because of these advantages, many companies decide to introduce or expand online
shopping to reach and serve a wide range of online shoppers.
Keywords: online, shopping, convenience.
