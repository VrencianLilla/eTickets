# eTickets
## Abstract
The topic of my thesis is the development and dockerization of the "eTickets" web
application in .NET programming language, which allows users to buy tickets online for
movies in different cinemas. Online shopping has been growing in popularity in recent
years and has become a common practice in many companies. There are several reasons
why it was introduced:
Convenience: Online shopping allows customers to access the Internet from home,
work or anywhere and easily purchase the products or services they want. They do not
need to be in person at traditional stores or make an appointment.
Wide selection: In the online space, customers have access to a huge selection of
products and services from many parts of the world. They are not limited to the inventory
of local stores and can easily compare prices, brands and quality from the comfort of their
own home.
Time saving: Online shopping is fast and efficient. Customers donâ€™t have to go
through multiple stores or stand in line to pay. They can simply buy and pay for a
product or service with a few clicks.
Because of these advantages, many companies decide to introduce or expand online
shopping to reach and serve a wide range of online shoppers.
Keywords: online, shopping, convenience.

## Programs, technologies presentation
### Built-in software, libraries
To create my project, I used Visual Studio, which is a software development tool
environment. Within this, I wrote the desired eTickets using the .NET framework in C#
my web application. I also dockerized my project, which helps that it is
my application can run smoothly in any environment. To store data
I used MySQL Workbench. I managed it with the DBeaver database management tool,
to make querying and uploading data easier.
### .NET Framework
.NET is a framework that helps in software development. The .NET framework (the .NET Framework) is used in various programming languages such as C#, Visual
It enables developers to build Windows-based applications and web services through Basic.NET, F#, or others. I used C# because this
programming language was found to be the most suitable language for building .NET web applications.
The .NET framework is used in many application areas, including web development ASP.NET, desktop applications (WPF), database and server-side applications and games. My project in ASP.NET web application development framework
is implemented.
ASP.NET
ASP.NET is a free web framework for building great websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also web APIs
you can create and use real-time technologies such as Web Sockets. The
ASP.NET provides three frameworks for creating web applications: Web Forms,
ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web Pages. Great web with all three frameworks
we can create applications. No matter what framework you choose, ASP.NET
you get all its benefits and functions everywhere.
11
Each framework targets a different development style. The chosen programming tools (knowledge, skills and development experience), the application to be created
depends on the combination of your type and the development approach that works for you.
ASP.NET MVC
For my project, I implemented it with ASP.NET MVC. ASP.NET MVC provides a powerful, pattern-based way to build dynamic websites that allows for clean separation of concerns and full control over markup
for enjoyable, agile development.
MVC
The MVC framework consists of the following main components:
1. Model: This represents the data content and business logic of the web application. Data structures, database connections and business logic can be found here
implementation.
2. View: This is responsible for displaying data to users. Views are HTML-based templates.
3. Controller: This mediates the data between the View and the Model. This is a first
it accepts requests from users as a step, and then handles events
and finally they perform data processing.
